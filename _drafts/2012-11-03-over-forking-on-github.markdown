I had a discussion with some fellow coders I didn't know well, there were 3 of us.  
Let's call them a <code>Startup CTO</code>, a <code>Developer</code>, and a <code>Coder</code>.

We we're discussing "over"-forking on github. How some people look at github when hiring, and how and what it means to fork a repository. [something][blah]

## Before the conversation started:

- <code>Coder</code>, is against "over"-forking on github.
- <code>Startup CTO</code>, proposed that "over"-forking for street cred is "part of the game", and didn't mind it.
- <code>Developer</code>, was indifferent.

<code>Coder's Opinions (thats me)</code>

Forking isn't contributing. Yes it appears on your github homepage, but that means nothing. It did affect Github's bottom line at one point, and so they had to change how they store repos, because of all the "over"-forking they called it __resource-sharding__?.

## After the conversation ended:

Nothing changed.

Conclusion, Github added Starring to show interest, yet people still fork.
