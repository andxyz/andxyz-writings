# Starting something new

People.

People make things.

Rocks sit still, watching, and are used. Do not be a rock. Well, not all the time, at least.

People write something to tell you to "Start something new." People sit down and write like Don Draper. Don Draper wrote about when he lost his job. His job to sell cigarettes. He wrote, "Why I'm Quitting Tobacco." Sort of a _goodbye_ to old employers, _hello_ to personal health. People put their writings on the wall and let us read. They do it to stir in you a will to start something new.

I will do it now.

Please, for your health. Start something new. Put the "I will get to that later" off the table.

Reach to the thing you want. Pick up the one you love. Create something of love.

Not because you are a control freak who likes to be possesive. No one likes those people. Do it because you are creative.

You create. Start it. Build it.

Why is it that,
When I go to start something new, I think of the new year. I think of _new_ _years_ _resolutions_. I sit and think about how I am doing. How am I doing, since the last time I sat and thought about it. Since the last time, I did _this_. Then suddenly I go off. I go off to look at:

- old resolution lists
- old blog posts (about making something, about that new start, new job, new project, new X)
- and to listen to an old speech, a speech about a dream

As I sit to think, reading my resolution lists. I realize something. They point back at me. They point at who I am. My due north. They point to what I have wanted from the world for a long time.

For myself, old resolution lists look exactly like new ones.

- Create more
- Do more art
- Put it online

When I go off to start something new. I begin by cleaning my computer desk. The new things I start begin with cleaning.

- Here at my computer desk
- Here at my workshop

I have recently visited a friend's workshop. A friend nearby me, in Toronto. I live in West Toronto. They live in East Toronto. Aside from them living and being a sort of Nega-Toronto-Me (that I will have to fight one day). The visit to the east made me realize something. The east brought me wisdom. Maybe, just maybe, I should not destroy them.

I learned, I do not maintain my workshop at home.

I placed my computer desk to be in the center of my home. So that I, as a person, would not always be hidden away. Tucked away deep within "my lab."

I have learned, a central hub desk is good for leisure time. However, it is not leisure time I share with my partner. In a matter of speaking, it is a failed leisure. I need a place of shared leisure.

I have learned, I need a place "of create." With my central hub desk, during a time when I should create, I do not create. I need a desk. I need a lab. I need a workshop.

I have a large home, I have a few rooms (with doors even), I have ample opportunity to have a clean desk.
I have not one clean desk. I do not maintain the desk to be clean. I put things on it. I put "get to that later" things all over the desk.

Lately I have been going to coffee shops to work. They have a table, a desk with nothing on it. A large glass window with sunlight from the street. The coffee shop has none of my "get to that later" things lying around. No past projects. No property of mine. No unread mail lazing about.

I hate sentences that just flip the verb or noun, or flip the sentence to a negative. I will give an example:

"I say what I mean, but I don't mean what I say"

I made that one up. I hate how that sentence pretends to present meaning. How it forces the brain to try to extract a lesson.

Anothing thing that bothers me, is when I learn the same lesson again and again. Like when I get angry at someone because I am hungry. I must remember to eat before I get upset.

The following sentence has meaning, I will live it the rest of my life:

>> "The things you own, end up owning you."

I have learned this lesson a million times, I will live it a million more.

I have started something by writing this piece.

First I cleaned my server. I setup my server to serve "https" content. I upgraded software on the server. I cleaned old files off the server. I setup a new computer. I cleaned old configs for my new computer.

My actions tell me something. I want a place to work. I will create.

Put yourself on hold too long and the world passes you by. You can live, right now.
