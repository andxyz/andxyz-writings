# Step 1

## if you are a newbie to ruby and rake. 

ruby is the language, `rake` is like `make` they start everything <code>r</code> that's a ruby version of a unix tool. it's the same old same old really.

Figuring out how to do some simple things was easy. It's all listed in the <code>README.markdown</code> and the <code>Rakefile</code>. Good comments, seems pretty clear, would appreciate an example on how to make a post. The syntax is a little confusing, with the quoting headaches <code>rake new_post['my post title']</code>
