## Step 1: If you are a newbie to ruby and rake. 

Ruby is the language, `rake` is like `make` they start everything with <code>r</code> that is a ruby-esque version of a unix tool. Same old, same old, really.

Figuring out how to do some simple things was easy. It's all listed in the [README.markdown][readme] and the [Rakefile][rakefile]. Good comments, seems pretty clear.

The syntax for a new post <code>rake new_post['my post title']</code>

## People I like 

The following inspired me to take the plunge into this beefed up jekyll world of octopress:

## Tweaks
- I tweaked the theme scss, and layout files heavily
- This [redcarpet2 markdown plugin][plugin] is awesome, get's me closer to [github flavored markdown][gfm]
- You can read up on the [Liquid templates engine][liquid], [Jekyll][jekyll], and [Octopress][octopress] if you want
