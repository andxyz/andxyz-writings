I had a discussion with some fellow coders I didn't know well, there were 3 of us.  
Let's call them a <code>CTO</code>, a <code>Developer</code>, and a <code>Coder</code>.

We we're discussing "over"-forking on github. How some people look at github when hiring, and how and what it means to fork a repository. [something][blah]

When the conversation started:

- <code>Coder</code>, is against "over"-forking on github.
- <code>CTO</code>, proposed that "over"-forking is part of the game, and didn't mind it.
- <code>Developer</code>, was indifferent.

<code>Coder's</code>, was opposed and his opinions were that:

1. Forking doesn't not mean you contribute, and often means someone will fork your fork. Yes it appears on your github homepage, but it means nothing. It did affect Github's bottom line at one point, and so they had to change how they store repos, because of all the "over"-forking they called it sharding.

2. Some other point

3. third and final point lets not overdue this

Conclusion, Starring, and perhaps a blog post containing your listing of your favorite open source projects from time to time like [Chris Wanstrath][ozmm-best-of-2009] (a hubber himself)
