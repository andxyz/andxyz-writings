I Participated as a mentor for [Ladies Learning Code - Ruby Workshop](http://ladieslearningcode.com/2012/12/introduction-to-ruby-is-back/), volunteering at these events has been great. 

below is my response to their feedback email <sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup>

### 1) Why did you attend this Ladies Learning Code workshop?
Ruby is awesome, Rails is awesome because of it. Get on the web already!

### 2) What was your FAVOURITE part and LEAST favourite part of the workshop?
**Favorite Part**: 
Seeing all the mentors come out, I met Matt (who was finding himself in a CTO position and working hard in Toronto) he was awesome. We got to talk shop, and we had some fun together, great guy.

**Worst Part**: 
Dealing with the older Lady in the back who had a 5-10 year old 
pc-windows-laptop thing that was all enterprise junked up and super slow to work on. Just one of the reasons I'm on a Mac laptop. It was so draining to get her setup and learning, she was approx. 20-minutes behind the class. Plus she was an older woman, so she has a slower learning rate (not her fault). The whole experience had me very upset, but I had my _calm-face_ on and stayed cheery for her sake while I got her though, and all caught up. The neat thing is that I was able to move and help someone else, and some other mentor took over. Because of that, she was able to get fresh patience, and really attentive advice. Later I saw her working away happily. So that was awesome. I believe switching my attention benefited both of us, and we continued on the day working at full capacity. That's what it's all about.

### 3) Feedback on the Lead Instructor(s)
Ryan Brunner and Brad Robertson from [influitive.com](http://www.influitive.com). They were great, tag-teamed very well. Teaching a classroom of people a new programming language is tough, there are so many double meanings for words and technical lingo. I think they were excellent.
