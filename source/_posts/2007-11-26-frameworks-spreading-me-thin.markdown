With all the reading I've been doing it troubles me that I haven't really learned much. It's more a kind of weighing procedure to see which way my implementation will go. There's <code>ASP</code>, <code>Coldfusion</code>, and <code>PHP</code> on my Radar. <code>Ruby on Rails</code> is not an option for this small a non technical business. So I figure I'll end up using <code>PHP</code> with a lot of template jazz and javascript frameworks to get my job done. I just hope it has the cleanliness of code that <code>coldfusion</code> has, with the limitless functionality <code>ASP</code> has, but the cross-browser functionality javascript frameworks have (I'm talking to you <code>jquery</code>), all with the 'price-point' of open-source.
