It's just 4 easy steps.

For example, it'd be as easy as signing in here www.google.com/a/examplecompany.org

## Step 1.
 Just go here to sign up https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/standard/new (free for under 10 users)

## Step 2.
 Verify your domain (in the <code>setup</code> area after you sign in)
