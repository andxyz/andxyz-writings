## Getting google apps (for free!) for your domain  

This way you can have andrew@examplecompany.com (but it will be gmail that you sign into)

Like this
www.google.com/a/examplecompany.com

1. Just go here to sign up https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/standard/new3
2. Verify your domain (in the settings area after you sign in)
3. Then edit your dns mail records (you might need you webmaster to help you with this)
4. Now you can setup ms-outlook or apple-mail:  
Using IMAP with your email client (ex: outlook)
