Goals to work toward for professional development.

## Application
some ideas:
- excel-regex-cleanup ([node](https://github.com/wdavidw/node-csv-parser) vs [python](http://docs.python-tablib.org/en/latest/) [rails](https://github.com/wtn/csv_records))
- tournament manager
- group-room-management

## Slides
- http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/<br>
- keynote vs html5slides vs dzslides

## Conference in Toronto
- Throne of JS, would've enjoyed it immensely
